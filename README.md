SpaceInvaders
=============

A simple version of the classic Space Invaders Game.
This is just some practice for me when learning how to
create games with Java.

Included Features:
------------------
* Enemies that move side-to-side and down over time.
* Movable Player character.
* Pause Game
* Multiple Enemy Types, with varied characteristics.
* Custom graphics for sprites
* Better looking background.
* Degrading barriers to hide behind.

Planned Features:
-----------------
* 'Bonus' enemies (Quick to disappear, high scoring).
* Boss Fights
* 'Power-ups' (Perhaps dropped by bonus enemies).

Current Status:
---------------
The Project is now in Alpha, not all features fully developed,
any feedback welcome!
