SpaceInvaders
=============

A simple version of the classic Space Invaders Game.
This is just some practice for me when learning how to
create games with Java.

Included Features:

* Enemies that move side-to-side and down over time.
* Movable Player character.
* Pause Game
* Multiple Enemy Types, with varied characteristics.

Planned Features:
-----------------
* 'Bonus' enemies (Quick to disappear, high scoring).
* Boss Fights
* Better graphics for all sprites. Perhaps animated.
* Better looking background.

Current Status:
---------------
The project is currently in development, and not runnable.
